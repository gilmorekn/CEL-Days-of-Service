## Community Engage Leadership at App State, Days of Service Fall 2023 Program Overview
### The Metrics
There has been increasing research on the value of the intersection between geography and community engagement (Rock, 2021). The CEL Days of Service program aims to provide equitable service opportunities for App State students three times a semester. The office of CEL works with local High Country non-profit organizations to establish community partnerships and service opportunities for students to get involved in the community. 

### Recommended for 
This map would be useful for the office of Community Engaged Leadership to provide an interactive overview of the Days of Service program per semester or year. Additionally, students could view the map to learn about the Days of Service program and the local non-profits who are invovled with the CEL office. 

### Functions
Feature functions include a visually appealing webmap with text box colors reflecting the CEL branding kit. A user may click each location icon to learn details about the Day of Service site. Links to each Community Partner's home page can be easily navigated. Lastly, a CEL custom color map of App State campus can be found via the 'campus map' button. 


### Data Sources
